  Abstract                 = {Biological visual systems cannot measure the properties that define the physical world. Nonetheless, visually guided behaviors of humans and other animals are routinely successful. The purpose of this article is to consider how this feat is accomplished. Most concepts of vision propose, explicitly or implicitly, that visual behavior depends on recovering the sources of stimulus features either directly or by a process of statistical inference. Here we argue that, given the inability of the visual system to access the properties of the world, these conceptual frameworks cannot account for the behavioral success of biological vision. The alternative we present is that the visual system links the frequency of occurrence of biologically determined stimuli to useful perceptual and behavioral responses without recovering real-world properties. The evidence for this interpretation of vision is that the frequency of occurrence of stimulus patterns predicts many basic aspects of what we actually see. This strategy provides a different way of conceiving the relationship between objective reality and subjective experience, and offers a way to understand the operating principles of visual circuitry without invoking feature detection, representation, or probabilistic inference.},

attention, but most of the resources and systems built so far are tailored to
English and other Indo-European languages. The need for designing systems for
other languages is increasing, especially as blogging and micro-blogging websites
become popular throughout the world. This paper surveys different techniques
for SSA for Arabic. After a brief synopsis about Arabic, we describe the
main existing techniques and test corpora for Arabic SSA that have been introduced
in the literature.},

on these products through online reviews. Sentiment analysis can be used
to extract valuable information from reviews, and the results can benefit both
consumers and manufacturers. This research shows a study which compares
two well known machine learning algorithms namely, dynamic language model
and naïve Bayes classifier. Experiments have been carried out to determine the
consistency of results when the datasets are of different sizes and also the effect
of a balanced or unbalanced dataset. The experimental results indicate that both
the algorithms over a realistic unbalanced dataset can achieve better results than
the balanced datasets commonly used in research.},

  Abstract                 = {<p>This tutorial reviews image alignment and image stitching algorithms. Image
 alignment algorithms can discover the correspondence relationships among images
 with varying degrees of overlap. They are ideally suited for applications such as
 video stabilization, summarization, and the creation of panoramic mosaics. Image
 stitching algorithms take the alignment estimates produced by such registration
 algorithms and blend the images in a seamless manner, taking care to deal with
 potential problems such as blurring or ghosting caused by parallax and scene
 movement as well as varying image exposures. This tutorial reviews the basic
 motion models underlying alignment and stitching algorithms, describes effective
 direct (pixel-based) and feature-based alignment algorithms, and describes
 blending algorithms used to produce seamless mosaics. It ends with a discussion
 of open research problems in the area.</p>},

- Assumes a parameter weight vector such that the score is linear in the weight and some representation of the input/output pair
 - e.g. for POS tagging, there is a parameter/weight for each "feature" that depends on the input and tag history (similar to features used in MaxEnt models) and inference is done with Viterbi
 - e.g. for parsing, there will be weights for each production rule, and inference is done with CKY
- At each iteration in training, paramters that caused errors are modified additively (increased or decreased by adding a correction term)
- Needs an inference algorithm to find the actual output predicted model (e.g. Viterbi algorithm can be used for sequence label prediction such as POS tagging)},
